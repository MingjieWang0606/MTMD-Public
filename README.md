Machine learning models are shown to be prospective in stock trend forecasting. However, the real-world stock market is always dynamic and volatile, making stock trends stochastic and unpredictable. Previous models use temporal information lysing in historical stock price patterns to predict the future stock trends, there are still difficulties with the multi-scale temporal dependence of financial data and capturing stable and efficient trading opportunities. Therefore, it is still challenging for these models to recognize the real profit signals from the noisy information. In this paper, we propose a framework based on Multi-scale Temporal Memory Learning and Efficient Debiasing (MTMD), which not only aggregates comprehensive local information such price sequence, stock concepts in each timestamp, but also specially concentrates on significant historical patterns globally and memorizes them across the entire time flow included in the training time span. Extensive ablation studies and experiments demonstrate that MTMD outperforms the previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods under various metrics.
